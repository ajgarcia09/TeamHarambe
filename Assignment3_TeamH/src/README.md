Task 2:

Task 3:
	Implementation of three use cases for our Activity Tracking System:
	 Account.java - used to create/sign into an account
	 Accounts.txt - account data is stored here
	 SetFitnessGoals.java - allows the user to set up and manage his or her fitness goals
	 RemindersAlarm.java - allows the user to set up and manage reminders and alarms
	 *Please note that since these files represent only a fraction of the tracking system, all functionalities are not fully implemented.
